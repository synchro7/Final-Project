Product Detail
---------
Beat Hazard is a game in which content is in some way generated by data outside the game itself. In the case of Beat Hazard this data comes in the form of the player's music. The game comes with a few songs to start with, but can be infinitely expanded upon by the player's own tastes and content.

Beat Hazard was developed by Cold Beam Games and is ranked in the top 20 for the XNA Dream Build Play 2010 Challenge.
