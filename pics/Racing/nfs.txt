Need for Speed Rivals is a 2013 racing video game set in an open world environment. Developed by Ghost Games and Criterion Games,

Rivals features gameplay somewhat similar to the earlier Hot Pursuit, with exotic cars and high-speed police chases.[5] Players take on the role of a Racer or a Cop, with each side of the law offering its own set of challenges, risks and rewards.[6] Rivals features eleven upgradeable gadgets such as EMPs, shockwaves and the ability to call in roadblocks.[5] The game takes place in a fictional location known as Redview County. It's an open world and features over 100 miles (160 km) of open road, larger than that of 2012's Most Wanted, but on the same size as Criterion's Hot Pursuit.[7] The open world features a similar set-up to Most Wanted, with several jumps, speed traps and unlockable cars, as well as shortcuts that are not shown on the map.
